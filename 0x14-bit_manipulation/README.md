##C-Bit manipulation Alx Project #0x14
###Learning Objectives
####What is Bit Manipulation
*Bit manipulation is a technique used in computer programming to manipulate individual bits or groups of bits within a binary number. It involves using bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) and bit shifts (left shift, right shift) to change the values of bits in binary numbers.

*Bit manipulation is often used in low-level programming, such as in embedded systems, device drivers, and operating systems, where efficiency and control over hardware is critical. It can be used to perform various tasks, such as setting, clearing or toggling individual bits, checking if a specific bit is set or not, counting the number of set bits in a binary number, and more.

*Some common use cases for bit manipulation include:

*Optimizing memory usage by storing multiple boolean flags in a single byte or word.
*Working with hardware interfaces that require specific bit patterns to be sent or received.
*Implementing efficient data structures such as bit arrays or bitmaps.
*Cryptography and hashing algorithms, where bit manipulation is used to perform bitwise operations on binary data.
*While bit manipulation can be a powerful tool, it can also be complex and error-prone. It requires a good understanding of binary arithmetic and the behavior of bitwise operators. Careful attention must be paid to avoid common pitfalls such as signed/unsigned conversions and buffer overflows.
#####Requirements for the project
#General
*Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
*All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
*All your files should end with a new line
*A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
*Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
*You are not allowed to use global variables
*No more than 5 functions per file
*The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
*You are allowed to use _putchar
*You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
*In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
*The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
*Don’t forget to push your header file
*All your header files should be include guarded
